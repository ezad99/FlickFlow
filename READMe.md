# Prototype README

## Project Overview
This prototype implements a gesture-based input system using quick flicking gestures that correspond to different virtual buttons. These gestures are distinguished by the number of flicks and the orientation of the device. The goal is to provide an intuitive and efficient way of interacting with a system through motion-based inputs.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects quick flicking gestures in different orientations.
- **Multiple Inputs:** Supports five distinct gestures.
- **Orientation-Based Inputs:** Differentiates between horizontal and vertical phone positions.

## Gesture Mapping
The system recognizes the following gestures:

### Horizontal Phone Position
1. **Single Flick** → Action 1
2. **Double Flick** → Action 2
3. **Triple Flick** → Action 3

### Vertical Phone Position
4. **Single Flick** → Action 4
5. **Double Flick** → Action 5

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```sh
   npm install / pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the prototype:
   ```sh
   npm start / python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Hold the phone in either a **horizontal** or **vertical** position.
- Perform flicking motions to trigger corresponding actions.
- The system will detect the gesture and execute the mapped function.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve gesture detection accuracy.
- Add support for more gestures.
- Expand compatibility across different devices.
