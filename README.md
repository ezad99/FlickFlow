# Flick Flow

## Introduction
This project aims to create a gesture-based interaction system for smartphones, designed to work in adverse weather conditions (like rain or snow), where touch input might not be effective. The goal is to use quick flicking gestures to activate buttons and control smartphone functions without needing to touch the screen.

## Design

### Main Design
The system will recognize quick flick gestures and activate corresponding buttons. The gestures will be differentiated by:
1. **Horizontal Phone Position**
   - Single Flick
   - Double Flick
   - Triple Flick
2. **Vertical Phone Position**
   - Single Flick
   - Double Flick

These gestures will be mapped to specific smartphone functions like video recording, camera control, etc.

### Rationale
This design was inspired by the challenges faced while recording videos in wet conditions, where touchscreens become unresponsive due to water on the phone or hands. By using flick gestures, the user can perform actions without the need to touch the screen.

### Recognized Weaknesses
A key challenge is distinguishing between intentional flicks and unintentional movements, which might trigger the wrong action.

## Implementation

### Software & Tools Used
- **JavaScript** for gesture detection (device motion events)
- **HTML** for the user interface
- **CSS** for basic styling

### Interaction Flow & Use of Thresholds
The system uses thresholds based on acceleration values to detect the strength of the flick gestures. For example:
- A single flick might be detected if the acceleration exceeds a certain threshold.
- A double or triple flick can be distinguished by the timing and number of flicks.

### Challenges & Issues
- Ensuring reliable detection of flick gestures.
- Handling false positives caused by unintentional phone movement.

## Testing & Deployment
The system will be tested in real-world conditions, focusing on the accuracy of gesture detection in different environmental conditions (e.g., rain, snow, or shaking).

## Evaluation
User feedback will be gathered to assess the system's usability, reliability, and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Future Refinements and Alternative Designs
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning gesture recognition algorithms.
- Add haptic feedback to confirm gesture recognition.
- Explore alternative gesture types, such as swipe gestures or tilts.

## Conclusion
The Quick Flick Gesture System aims to provide an innovative solution to control smartphone functions without needing to touch the screen, especially in challenging environments like rain.
